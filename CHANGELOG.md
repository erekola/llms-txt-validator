# turva-llms-txt-validator changelog

## 0.1.4 (2026-07-24)

VERSION is now read from package.json at module load, so the exported
VERSION and the HTTP User-Agent can no longer drift from the published
version (0.1.1 and 0.1.3 both shipped with a stale hardcoded string).
README and the package description now say eight checks, matching the
hosted validator page; the no-html check moved from a footnote into the
checks table as row 8. Bugs URL moved to GitHub issues (the repository
has been GitHub-canonical since 2026-07-21). No check logic changes.

## 0.1.1 (2026-07-18)

Restores the llms-txt-validate CLI command. npm rejected the ./-prefixed bin
path at publish time and stripped the bin mapping from 0.1.0, so 0.1.0
installs without the command. No code changes.

## 0.1.0 (2026-07-18)

First release. The seven structural checks of the hosted validator at
turva.dev/llms-txt-validator, extracted as an ES module with a CLI
(llms-txt-validate), a node:test suite, and the same JSON result shape as the
hosted endpoint.
